All I learned in langgraph course from langchain academy 

# Module 1 
In this module we will introduce several generic agent architecture and some common challenges faced by developers in building agents . 
We will discuss why building custom agents with domain specific workflows and focus on high reliability is really important.
Finally we will show how langgraph makes it easy to build these custom agents 

### Lesson 1 - motivation 
In this lesson, I learned why LangGraph is valuable for building more complex LLM applications. Instead of working with simple, linear chains, LangGraph enables the creation of dynamic, graph-based workflows with loops, branching, and shared state. This makes it much easier to design agent-like systems that can make decisions, use tools, and adapt during execution. It also improves debugging and scalability by offering better visibility into the workflow.
*My work* - There was no code provided in this videoâ€”it primarily focused on basic and introductory concepts.
